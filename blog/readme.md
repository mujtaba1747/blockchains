## Instructions to build project and add a blog-post

* Ensure Go is installed

* Ensure Starport is installed

* cd into blog

* Make sure the env variable GOPATH is set. Can be checked by running :
  
```bash
echo $GOPATH
```

In case this env variable is not set, it can be set using :

```bash
export GOPATH="/home/go"
```


* Run
```bash
starport chain serve
```

* Run
```bash
make
```

* Run or cd into your GOPATH
```bash
cd $GOPATH
```

* Run
```bash
./blogd tx blog create-post "My first post" "This is a post\!" --from=alice --chain-id="blog"
```

**blog** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

## Get started

```
starport chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Starport docs](https://docs.starport.network).

### Launch

To launch your blockchain live on multiple nodes, use `starport network` commands. Learn more about [Starport Network](https://github.com/tendermint/spn).

### Web Frontend

Starport has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Starport front-end development](https://github.com/tendermint/vue).

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.starport.network/example/blog@latest! | sudo bash
```
`example/blog` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).
